// Errors & Exception in java:
/* 
ERRORS: there are 3 types of errors
1. Syntax errors: These are errors that occur when the compiler encounters a syntax error in the code
                  example: int a = 9 ---------------------> semicolon ; is missing
2. Runtime errors: These are errors that occur during the execution of the program
                   example: int a = 9 / 0 ---------------------> division by zero
                            unable to pull or fetch data
3. Logical errors: These are errors that occur when the program does not produce the expected output
                   example: int a = 9; int b = 9; if(a == b)
